1. Sync_vector module is called three times during execution of FHI-aims, while each calling for Sync_vector module corresponds to two parts of MPI_Allreduce.
2. The cost of Sync_vector module is marked by the second of the two "Sync_vector:"
3. The cost of MPI_Allreduce is the sum of "Allreduce_part1" and "Allreduce_part2"
